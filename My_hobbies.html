        <h1>Hobbies and Career</h1>
        <p> From my early childhood I was playing basketball and even attended the training camp of under 16 of our national team</p>
        <p> My passion for basketball has ended and I focused fully on studies</p>
        <p> After my freshman year I went to London and got a job in a busy bar located in Covent Garden - suddenly fell in love with it.</p>
        <p> Since then I have worked in 2 high end bars in London and got a lot of experience.</p>
        <p> After that I went to the states and worked in Ocean City, Maryland.</p>
        <p> Now I work as the head bartender in my hometown at Irish Nese Pub and at the same time I compete in numerous championships</p>
